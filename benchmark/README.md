# zstor benchmark

`zstor benchmark` provides tools to analyse the performance of `zstor`.

## Getting started

Compile and install the current version of `zstor` by running the following command in the `0-stor` root:
```bash
make install
```

To start the benchmarking, provide a YAML [config file](#orchestrator-config-file) for the `benchmark orchestrator` (`0-stor/benchmark/orchestrator/orchestrator.py`) and run the `orchestrator` Python script:
``` bash
python3 orchestrator.py --conf bench_config.yaml
```

Orchestrator flags:
``` bash
usage: orchestrator.py [-h] [-C string] [--out string]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            help for orchestrator
  -C,  --conf string     path to the config file (default bench_config.yaml)
  --out, string          directory where the benchmark report will be
                        written (default ./report)
```

## Benchmark orchestrator
  
The orchestrator sets up a benchmarking environment (zstordb and etcd metadata servers) and uses [`zstorbench`](../cmd/zstorbench/README.md) to collect the performance data. The orchestrator will generate the config files with scenarios and environment configuration for [`zstorbench`](../cmd/zstorbench/README.md) and process the output (of multiple zstorbench runs) to generate a report.

### Supported deployment options:
  * local - deploys `zstor` servers on 1 local device
  * `packet.net` - deploys `zstor` servers on a [`packet.net`](https://packet.net) device. 

### Orchestrator config

Config file for the `benchmark orchestrator` consists of three parts (main fields):

  * `benchmarks`: configuration of what to benchmark
  * `template`: template configuration for [`zstorbench`](../cmd/zstorbench/README.md) client
  * `profile`: defines the type of profiling that's done during benchmarking

Additional optional fields are:
  * `packet.net`: configuration for `packet.net` deployment. More information of [`packet.net`](https://packet.net). If field is not given, `zstor` servers are deployed locally. Additional instructions for [`packet.net`](https://packet.net) deployment are given [bellow](#packet.det-deployment)
  * `branch`: defines a branch for benchmarking and used for [`packet.net`](https://packet.net) deployment.

The `benchmarks` field contains information to build the benchmarking scenarios. In case if `benchmarks` is not provided, the benchmark will run for a single set of parameters, provided in the `template`.

The config for each benchmark is marked by the `prime_parameter` field and an optional `second_parameter` field can be defined. Inside both `prime_parameter` and `second_parameter` field the `id` specifies what zstor config field is being benchmarked. The `range` field specifies the different values for that zstor config field being used in the benchmarks.

If only `prime_parameter` is given, the `orchestrator` creates a plot of the throughput versus values in `range` of the `prime parameter`.
If both `prime_parameter` and `second_parameter` are given, a few plots will be combined in the output figure, one for each value in `range` of `second_parameter`.

The `template` field represents the template of the config file for [`zstorbench`](../cmd/zstorbench/README.md).

Number of `zstordb` servers to be run is deducted from `distribution_data` + `distribution_parity`. The number of `etcd` metadata servers to be run is defined by `meta_shards_nr`.

The `iyo` field contains the credentials for [`itsyou.online`](https://itsyou.online), used for authentication during the benchmark. If the sub fields are empty or the `iyo` field itself is omitted, the benchmarks will run without authentication.  
If authentification is enabled, the `namespace` fields needs to be a valid [`itsyou.online`](https://itsyou.online) namespace, if authentification is disabled, any name can be used or it can be omitted for a random one to be generated.

The `profile` field sets the type of profiling done during benchmarking, if empty, invalid or omitted, no profiling will be done. Valid options are: `cpu`, `mem`, `block`, `trace`.

# * in the output figures 'prime_parameter.range' is used in the x-axis, while 'second_parameter.range' enables multiplot.
# ** if both 'operations' and 'duration' are given, the benchmarking stops on the first condition met.
```

## Orchestrator report

The orchestrator will put the generated report into the default folder (`./report`) or the one provided by the `--out` flag.

After the `orchestrator` has run, this folder wil contain a `report.md` Markdown file that contains:
* The config of the benchmark
* Generated figures of the run benchmarks 
* Textual representation of the graph

Example of a report Markdown file can be found [here](assets/example_report/report.md)

The field `result_output` defines a time interval to collect intermediate data throughout the benchmark and takes values `per_second`, `per_minute` or `per_hour`. These samples are used to create time plots during the benchmark. The time plots by default are collected in `timeplots.md` If `result_output` is empty or invalid time plots are not included.

Example of a time plot report Markdown file can be found [here](assets/example_report/timeplots.md)

The profiling results can be found in the `profile_information` sub-folder.

Examples of generated figures for report.md:

## Packet.net deployment

Functions for deployment are included in the package [`zstor_packet_setup`](orchestrator/lib/zstor_packet_setup.py).
In order to start [`JumpScale`](https://github.com/Jumpscale) package has to be installed with this [installation guide](https://github.com/Jumpscale/bash).

To get a client for `packet.net` using [`JumpScale`](https://github.com/Jumpscale) primitives, we need to add an authentification token and a project name to the [`Config manager`]. There are two ways to open the form and add this information:

  1. Run 
  ``` bash
  js9_config configure -l j.clients.openvcloud -i test -s /root/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```
  2. Start `js9` and then call function to get the client \
  ``` bash 
  j.clients.packetnet.get()
  ```

Now the deployment using [`zstor_local_setup`](orchestrator/lib/zstor_packet_setup.py) can be performed.
