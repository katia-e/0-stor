# zstor benchmark client

Benchmark client provides tools for benchmarking and profiling zstor client for various scenarios.

Configuration for benchmarking scenarios should be given in YAML format (see [example](#benchmark-config) of the config file bellow).
Benchmarking program outputs results for all provided scenarios to a single output file in YAML format (see [example](#output file) of the output file bellow). 


## Getting started
Install all necessary `zstor` components by running
```bash
make install
```
In order to start a benchmarking run, all necessary [zstor servers](https://github.com/zero-os/0-stor/blob/master/docs/gettingstarted.md) have to be set up.

Start the benchmarking
``` bash
zstorbench -C config.yaml --out-benchmark benchmark.yaml
```

`zstorbench` has the following options:
``` bash
  -C, --conf string            path to a config file (default "config.yaml")
  -h, --help                   help for performance
      --out-benchmark string   path and filename where benchmarking results are written (default "benchmark.yaml")
      --out-profile string     path where profiling files are written (default "profile")
      --profile-mode string    enable profiling mode, one of [cpu, mem, trace, block]
```


Start benchmarking with optional input/output files
``` bash
zstorbench --conf "input_config.yaml" --out-benchmark "output_benchmark.yaml"
```

Start benchmarking and profiling
``` bash
zstorbench --out-profile "outputProfileInfo" --profile-mode cpu
```

## Benchmark config

Client config contains a list of scenarios. 
Each scenario is associated with a corresponding scenarioID and provides two sets of parameters: 
`zstor_config` and `bench_conf`.
Structure `zstor_config` are nessesary to create a `zstor client` and can be parsed into a type `client.Policy` of [zstor client package](https://github.com/zero-os/0-stor/tree/master/client). 

`iyo` has to be given in case if `zstor` server is running with flag `--no-auth` and, therefore, require no authentification via `itsyou.online`.
Note, that invalid `ioy` token lead to an error even if authentification is unset.

Structure `bench_conf` represents such benchmark parameters like duration of the performance test, maximum number of operations, maximum benchmark duration and output format.
One of two parameters `duration` and `operations` has to be provided. If both are given, the benchmarking program terminates as soon as one of the following events occurs:
 + number of executed operations reached `operations`
 + timeout set by `duration` elapsed

`method` defines which operation is benchmarked:
 + `read` - for reading from zstor
 + `write` - for writing to zstor

`result_output` specifies interval of the data collection (`perinterval` in the results) and can take values:  
 + per_second
 + per_minute
 + per_hour

if empty or invalid, there will be no interval data collection.

The following example of a config file represents a benchmarking scenario `bench1`.

``` yaml
scenarios:
  bench1:
    zstor_config:
      iyo:  # if empty or omitted, the zstordb servers set up for the benchmark 
            # need to be run with the no-auth flag.
            # For benching with authentication, provide it with valid itsyou.online credential
        organization: "bench_org"

      metastor:

## Output file

Benchmarking program writes results of the performance tests to an output file. All scenario configuration is collected in `scenario`. All numerical results can be fetched from `results`.

``` yaml
scenarios:
  bench1:
    results:
    - count: 367            # number of reads/writes performed during the benchmark
      duration: 5.0093327  # total duration of the benchmark
      perinterval:         # number of reads/writes per time unit
      - 84
      - 64
      - 67
      - 70
      - 82
    scenario:         # zstor config used for the benchmark

        organization: myorg  # itsyou.online organization name
